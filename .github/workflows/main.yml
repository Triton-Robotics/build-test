    colcon-defaults: # optional, default is 
    # Mixin repository containing the mixin(s) specified through colcon-defaults or colcon-extra-args
    colcon-mixin-repository: # optional, default is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/master/index.yaml
    # Ignore all files matching this pattern in the coverage report.
It will be injected in colcon-lcov-result --filter option.
Useful for ignoring tests or examples in the coverage report.

    coverage-ignore-pattern: # optional, default is 
    # Additional flags passed to CMake (using colcon build --cmake-args)

    extra-cmake-args: # optional, default is

    colcon-extra-args: # optional, default is 
    # GitHub personal access token (PAT) to use to import the repository.

The PAT should have the "repo" scope.

    import-token: # optional, default is 
    # Limit the package(s) to be built and tested.
If left empty this will build and test everything in the workspace - including packages from vcs-repo-file-url imports.
Passing multiple package names is allowed.
Package names can be separated by any whitespace character.

    package-name: # optional, default is 
    # ROS 2 distribution to target for the build.  Will be used both for
`rosdep install` and `source setup.bash`. Either or both of
`target-ros1-distro` and `target-ros2-distro`, but at least one must
be specified. Typically, both are specified when building packages
that rely on both ROS versions, such as the ros1_bridge.

    target-ros2-distro: humble
    # Repo file URL passed to vcs to initialize the colcon workspace.
The URL may point to a local file, such as file://path/to/file.txt.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/rolling/ros2.repos

    vcs-repo-file-url: # optional, default is 
    # Skip tests and code coverage data processing.

    # Do not use '--symlink-install' with 'colcon build'.
Set to 'true'.

    no-symlink-install: # optional, default is 
    # Check dependencies of packages using 'rosdep check'. Must be used with skip-rosdep-install.

Passing multiple keys is allowed.
Keys names can be separated by any whitespace character.

    rosdep-skip-keys: # optional, default is 
    # Branch or reference to checkout via vcstool.
If unset will use the branch from where this action was triggered.
